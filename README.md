## Introduction
In this project i implement a search engine using various algorithms like: ```tf-idf```, ```Word Embedding```, ```Inverted Index``` and also in phase three i use ```KNN``` and ```K-means``` for clustering and classifying that leads to boost speed of retrieving documents.<br>
I used two different dataset, The first one has more than 7k news and the second one has more than 50k news that i use the first one for building inverted index and i use the second dataset which has five diverse categories(```sport```, ```politics```, ```economy```, ```health``` and ```culture```) that use this dataset for labeling the news in first dataset.
